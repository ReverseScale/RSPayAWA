With Mr. Ma's cashless assumption, China has entered a new era of mobile payments. Even Apple in the United States can not afford to launch Apple Pay for a share. As the domestic mainstream payment only requires Alipay and WeChat to be paid, On a separate package of Apple Pay.

#### My Tech Blog: https://reversescale.github.io Welcome to step on

## üé® Why test the UI?

| 1 list page | 2 Alipay payment | 3 WeChat payment |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

| Set up a basic framework through the storyboard | Alipay page lack of related profiles | WeChat payment page without related profiles |

## üöÄ Advantage 
* 1. Less documents, code concise
* 2. At the same time support the mainstream nowadays payment methods
* 3. Packaging, call simple
* 4. Unified macro management registration, reduce the pressure on the code AppDelegate
* 5. Have a higher custom
* 6. To ensure that no conflict with the code and code pollution
* 7. Based on the official SDK production, safety and risk-free

## ü§ñ Requirements
* iOS 7+
* Xcode 8+

## üõ† Usage method
### The first step is to drag the tools folder into the project file
Folder: RSPayManager
### The second step to configure the environment
Introduced folder RSPayManager will certainly reported a lot of mistakes, do not be afraid, these unobtrusive red will soon disappear.

Followed by adding the shelf rack, note: WeChat, Alipay two rack package in the previous step has quietly entered.

Pay attention to the WeChat shelves relatively stubborn, so special treatment, otherwise there will be a chance when registering Crash ...

Fill out according to the project directory: my "$ (SRCROOT) /RSPayAWA/RSPayManager/WeChatPayLib/libWeChatSDK.a"

~ OK, the compiler should not be an error now.

### The third step is to set the parameters
In AppDelegate, do the following (remember to import the header file: #import "RSPayManager.h"):
```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
// Override point for customization after application launch.

[RSPAYMANAGER rs_registerApp];

return YES;
}
/**
*  @author DevelopmentEngineer-DWQ
*
*  The oldest version, it is best to write
*/
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {

return [RSPAYMANAGER rs_handleUrl:url];
}
/**
*  @author DevelopmentEngineer-DWQ
*
*  Will be called before iOS 9.0
*/
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {

return [RSPAYMANAGER rs_handleUrl:url];
}
/**
*  @author DevelopmentEngineer-DWQ
*
*  iOS 9.0 or above (including iOS9.0)
*/

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(nonnull NSURL *)url options:(nonnull NSDictionary<NSString *,id> *)options{

return [RSPAYMANAGER rs_handleUrl:url];
}
```
Is not very concise, compared to the official document simply to be happy to God, the latter can help AppDelegate slimming through the Method Swizzing way.

### The fourth step to use
```
// Apple Pay Â§¥Êñá‰ª∂
#import "RSApplePay.h"
// ÂæÆ‰ø°ÊîØ‰ªò„ÄÅÊîØ‰ªòÂÆùÂ§¥Êñá‰ª∂
#import "RSPayManager.h"
```

```
NSString *orderMessage = @"app_id=2015052600090779&biz_content=%7B%22timeout_express%22%3A%2230m%22%2C%22seller_id%22%3A%22%22%2C%22product_code%22%3A%22QUICK_MSECURITY_PAY%22%2C%22total_amount%22%3A%220.02%22%2C%22subject%22%3A%221%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%E6%88%91%E6%98%AF%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%22%2C%22out_trade_no%22%3A%22314VYGIAGG7ZOYY%22%7D&charset=utf-8&method=alipay.trade.app.pay&sign_type=RSA&timestamp=2016-08-15%2012%3A12%3A15&version=1.0&sign=MsbylYkCzlfYLy9PeRwUUIg9nZPeN9SfXPNavUCroGKR5Kqvx0nEnd3eRmKxJuthNUx4ERCXe552EV9PfwexqW%2B1wbKOdYtDIb4%2B7PL3Pc94RZL0zKaWcaY3tSL89%2FuAVUsQuFqEJdhIukuKygrXucvejOUgTCfoUdwTi7z%2BZzQ%3D";
[RSPAYMANAGER rs_payWithOrderMessage:orderMessage callBack:^(RSErrCode errCode, NSString *errStr) {
NSLog(@"errCode = %zd,errStr = %@",errCode,errStr);
}];
```
2.WeiChatPay
```
PayReq* req = [[PayReq alloc] init];
req.partnerId = @"10000100";
req.prepayId= @"1101000000140415649af9fc314aa427";

[RSPAYMANAGER rs_payWithOrderMessage:req callBack:^(RSErrCode errCode, NSString *errStr) {
NSLog(@"errCode = %zd,errStr = %@",errCode,errStr);
}];
```

3.Apple Pay (No deliberate package, access it according to demand)

3.1 proxy
```
<RSApplePayDelegate>
```
3.2 Click Action
```
RSApplePay *pay=[[RSApplePay alloc]initWithPayReceiver:@"Áî≥ÂÜ†Âçé" amount:@"5.20" presentVC:self];
[pay setDelegate:self];
```
3.3 Acting callback
```
//payment successful
- (void)RSApplePayDidSuccess{
NSLog(@"payment successful!");
}
//Payment failed
- (void)RSApplePayDidFailure{
NSLog(@"Payment failed!");
}

- (NSString *)generateTradeNO {
static int kNumber = 15;

NSString *sourceStr = @"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
NSMutableString *resultStr = [[NSMutableString alloc] init];
srand((unsigned)time(0));
for (int i = 0; i < kNumber; i++)
{
unsigned index = rand() % [sourceStr length];
NSString *oneStr = [sourceStr substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(index, 1)];
[resultStr appendString:oneStr];
}
return resultStr;
}
